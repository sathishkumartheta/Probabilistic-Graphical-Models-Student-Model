# Probabilistic-Graphical-Models-Student-Model

Pgmpy is a pure python implementation for Bayesian Networks with a focus on modularity and extensibility [1].
This notebook is an implementation of the student bayesian network from the book "Probabilistic Graphical Model- principles and techniques" authored by Daphne Koller and Nir Friedman [2]. The purpose of this notebook is to provide a pgmpy implementation of the student network to aid in the process of learning with the aforementioned book.
